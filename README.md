# Top-Attacking-IP-Addresses-Against-Wordpress-Sites

Lists of the top attacking IP addresses trying to hack or compromise Wordpress web sites.

Information is sourced from reports released monthly by Wordfence https://www.wordfence.com/

# Single List Output

I collate this information from Wordfence's reports and then merge them into a single list of bad IP's which can be used by anyone to block these IP's at iptables or other firewall level.
